# clicky-game

In this project we where introduced to [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/), a much different way of looking at the front end and rendering apps.

React uses [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html), which looks much like HTML but is really an extension of JavaScript. React, as the name suggests, is extreamly fast and renders the DOM very quickly, but only the parts that need to be rendered. It allows you to break up the page into different reusable components, which can be dynamicly created and modified.

My game is a memory style click based game, using characters from The Simpsons. You get one point for each click, as long as you don't click on the same image twice. The score and top score are stored in state and update as they are changed, so your top score will persist thruout the game, but not a full page reload.

Can you beat my best of 17? :)
